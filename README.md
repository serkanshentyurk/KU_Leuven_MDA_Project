# KU_Leuven_MDA_Project

## Running the project

```bash
# clone the repo
gh repo clone serkanshentyurk/KU_Leuven_MDA_Project

cd KU_Leuven_MDA_project

# install the dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# run the app
python index.py
```

runtime.txt and Procfile are needed for uploading to Heroku - not needed if planning to run the app locally.

The repo contains the data as well, not ideal but we didn't have time to sort AWS S3 buckets for the project >:(

You can find the (same) data here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uDH7_65T4JbVX_aRJuA3KC2fxBkbQT7f?usp=sharing
